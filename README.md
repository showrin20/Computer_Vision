Computer Vision is a specialized field within artificial intelligence (AI) aimed at teaching machines to "see" and interpret the world through visual data. By processing digital images or videos, computers can gain insights into scenes, objects, and actionsâ€”enabling applications across various industries. Unlike human vision, which is inherently biological, computer vision relies on digital data and mathematical models to achieve similar outcomes, interpreting images using a combination of pixel analysis, pattern recognition, and statistical models.
