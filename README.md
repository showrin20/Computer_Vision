# Computer_Vision
Computer vision has methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding the digital image. The most important task is to extract high dimensional data from the real world which can produce numerical or symbolic information.
OpenCV is an open-source library for the computer vision. It provides the facility to the machine to recognize the faces or objects. In this tutorial we will learn the concept of OpenCV using the Python programming language.



## The document contains several key formulas related to image processing:

1. **Gamma Correction**: 
   - \( I_{out} = I_{in}^{\gamma} \) (where \(\gamma\) is the gamma value).
   
2. **Alpha Compositing (Over Operator)**:
   - \( C_{out} = \alpha C_{f} + (1 - \alpha) C_{b} \) (where \(C_f\) is the foreground color, \(C_b\) is the background color, and \(\alpha\) is the alpha value).

3. **Brightness Adjustment** (Additive):
   - \( I_{out} = I_{in} + b \) (where \(b\) is the bias).

4. **Contrast Adjustment** (Multiplicative):
   - \( I_{out} = a \cdot I_{in} \) (where \(a\) is the gain).
